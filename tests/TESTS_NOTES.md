Notes on the Tests
====================

This file contains notes and problems to be solved with the tests.

testImageInputOutput.pas
--------------------------

testImageInputOutput.pas tests for correct input and output of the image files to be used in the program. If the test works correctly, the image input to the test and the image output from the test will be exactly equal (including colour).

Problems:

* The colour of the input image is different to that of the input image. In particular, the blue background of the input image becomes a shade of magenta in the output image.
